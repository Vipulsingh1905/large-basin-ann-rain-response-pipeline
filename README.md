## Introduction

Understanding how rainfall affects water discharge is crucial for effective water resource management, flood prediction, and environmental conservation. This project employs a sophisticated ANN to model and predict discharge based on rainfall data. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we aim to improve the accuracy of hydrological predictions.

## Features

- **Deep Learning**: Utilize advanced ANN architectures for better prediction accuracy.
- **Data Processing**: Seamlessly handle large datasets with efficient data pipelines.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Integrate spatial data for comprehensive analysis.
- **Monthly Predictions**: Focus on monthly timescales for practical applications.
- **Visualization**: Generate informative visualizations to interpret results easily.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates a range of technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for development.
- **PyTorch**: A powerful deep learning framework for building neural networks.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Xarray**: For handling multi-dimensional arrays, particularly useful for geospatial data.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive development and exploration.

   ```

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [Releases](https://github.com/Vipulsingh1905/large-basin-ann-rain-response-pipeline/releases) section.

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can start using the pipeline. Here‚Äôs a simple guide on how to run the model:

1. Prepare your data: Ensure your rainfall and discharge data is in the correct format.
2. Configure the model parameters: Adjust the settings in the configuration file as needed.
3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

For further instructions, check the [Releases](https://github.com/Vipulsingh1905/large-basin-ann-rain-response-pipeline/releases) section.

## Data

The quality of predictions heavily relies on the data used for training. This project requires historical rainfall and discharge data. You can source data from:

- National Weather Service (NWS)
- US Geological Survey (USGS)
- Local hydrological databases

Ensure the data is cleaned and formatted properly before feeding it into the model.

## Model Training

Training the ANN involves several steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize the data to improve model performance.
2. **Model Architecture**: Design the ANN architecture suitable for the task.
3. **Training**: Use the training script to fit the model on the data.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust parameters to optimize model performance.

The training process can be resource-intensive. Consider using a machine with a dedicated GPU for faster results.

## Results

After training the model, you can visualize the results to understand the performance better. The pipeline includes scripts to generate graphs and charts that compare predicted and actual discharge values.
